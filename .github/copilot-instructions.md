- I am using bun package manager

- Do not add unnecessary comments for my understanding.

- Icons are used from hugeicons if you want to add extra icons to the library, you can add it running `ic icon-name` command.
  `icon-name` is from the hugeicons website. Always use hyphen `-` to separate words in icon names.
`ic` is a standalone binary. No need to use it with bun or npm.

- No need to fix formatting related issues.

- You can use `bun ts` for type checking.
